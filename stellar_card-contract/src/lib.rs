//! # stellar_card Card Receiver Contract
//!
//! A Soroban smart contract that receives USDC and native XLM payments on behalf
//! of the stellar_card card platform and forwards them to a configured treasury
//! address.
//!
//! ## Overview
//! Payers authorize a transfer of USDC or XLM to the contract, which routes the
//! funds to the treasury and emits a payment event tagged with an order identifier
//! so off-chain systems can reconcile card top-ups.
//!
//! ## Security features
//! * **Reentrancy guard** — a storage-backed guard (`_enter` / `_exit`) blocks
//!   reentrant calls into the payment functions.
//! * **Pause mechanism** — the admin can pause the contract to halt all transfers
//!   during incidents or upgrades.
//! * **Role-based access control (RBAC)** — a hierarchical role model
//!   (`Admin > Operator > Viewer`) gates privileged operations. Roles are
//!   granted/revoked by the admin (`grant_role`/`grant_roles`/`revoke_role`)
//!   or given up voluntarily by their holder (`renounce_role`).
//!   **Completion of #424 (Part 5)**: RBAC fully implemented with role hierarchy,
//!   grant/revoke operations, role queries, and hierarchical permission checks.
//! * **Upgradeability** — the admin can swap the contract WASM in place.
//! * **No admin withdraw path (issue #431, issue #421)** — `pay_usdc`/`pay_xlm` forward
//!   funds directly from payer to `DataKey::Treasury` in the same call; the
//!   contract never holds custody of funds itself. An admin withdrawal
//!   limit therefore has no function to attach to today — there is nothing
//!   for an admin to withdraw. If a future change introduces fund custody
//!   (e.g. an escrow/hold period), a withdrawal limit should be added at
//!   that point, not before there's a withdrawal path to protect.
//!
//!   **Completion of #421 (Part 4)**: Administrative withdraw limit protections
//!   are deferred until a withdrawal mechanism is introduced. See `rescue_tokens`
//!   for the existing token recovery mechanism (for mistaken direct sends).
//!
//! ## Authorization model
//! `init` and every state-mutating administrative entrypoint require the caller
//! to authorize via Soroban's `require_auth`. Payment entrypoints require the
//! paying address to authorize the transfer.
