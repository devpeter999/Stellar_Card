# Deployment Scripts

This directory contains scripts for automating the deployment of the Stellar_Card smart contract.

## Prerequisites

Before running the deployment scripts, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (including the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target)
- [Soroban CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup)

## Environment Setup

The deployment scripts rely on standard Soroban CLI environment configuration.

You MUST set the following required environment variable before running the script:
- `SOURCE_ACCOUNT`: The configured identity name or secret key to deploy from.
  - Example: `export SOURCE_ACCOUNT=alice` (if you configured an identity named `alice`)

Optional environment variables:
- `NETWORK`: Specifies the target network. Defaults to `testnet` if not set.

Ensure you have created the identity and funded it on the target network before deploying:
```bash
# Example: Generate an identity named "alice" on testnet
soroban config identity generate --network testnet alice
```

## Running the Deployment

To deploy the contract to the testnet, simply execute the script:

```bash
./deploy_testnet.sh
```

## Expected Outputs

When executed, the script will:
1. Validate your environment variables and tool installations.
2. Build the contract (optimizing the WASM output).
3. Deploy the compiled WASM to the target network.
4. Output the deployed contract address.

**Example Output:**
```
